<p> Florida, the southeastern most state in the US, is certainly not a dull place. It is one of the largest states in the US and is home to a wide variety of ethnicities and cultures. Situated between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida is famed for its amusement parks and offers the largest selection of zoos, aquariums, theme parks and other family attractions found in any of the US states.

Florida also has an abundance of museums, art galleries, restaurants of all kinds and historical sights to offer visitors but despite all of its man-made wonders, Florida is also a spectacular place for nature lovers. The immense subtropical wilderness of the Everglades and the many barrier reefs are perfect for wildlife lovers. The swamplands offer a once in a lifetime opportunity to get close to a wild gator and the many beaches provide a chance of witnessing a nesting sea turtle.</p>
