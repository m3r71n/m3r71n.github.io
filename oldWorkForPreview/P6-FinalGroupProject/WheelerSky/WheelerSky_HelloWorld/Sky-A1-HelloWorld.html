    <h3>EP 2</h3>
    <h4>BLACK BILE</h4>
    <p>Black Bile is about my journey through Anxiety and Depression. I started off with severe depression. I would have really high moments and really low moments. I hid and sometimes still try t hide behind my many masks. People know me mainly because of my outgoing, cheerful, and bubbly personality. I've used my personality in many ways, I've used it to hide and to also get through my social anxiety. Growing up my mom would always tell me that people would hate me because of my bubbliness </p>
